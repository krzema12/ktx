# ktx

npx for kotlin and the JVM!
Install and execute JARs or kotlin scripts just like any other command line utility.

## Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpetuska/ktx/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpetuska/ktx/master/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Usage

After installation a new `ktx` command will appear in your terminal. The cli is self-documented so to explore its
features simply use `-h` argument on any command. e.g. `ktx -h`.

Main ones to know, however, are `ktx run <url>` and `ktx install <url>` which allow you to execute or install any kotlin
script of the internet.
